What is Lunux Shell?
A shell provide an environment to a user to execute commands and interact with Kernal.

There are different type of shell:
* Bash (Most commonly used type. That why now people call this Bash scripting in the place of shell scripting)
* sh (Old Version)
* ksh
* tsh
* fish
* zsh (Extended version of Bash Shell, more advanced)

When we use mac then we got default zsh shell, but most commonly in linux are bash shell.

You can check using
